# CVE-2025-61162: Incorrect Access Control in Cohere Platform Allows Unauthorized Modification and Deletion of User Accounts

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-61162
**Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control (CWE-284)
**Severity:** High
**Affected Component:** User Management API (`/api/internal/v1/users/{{USER_ID}}`)
**Vendor:** Cohere
**Discovered by:** Bahaa Dadoa — ViperX Security Research Team
**Date Publicly Disclosed:** November 2025

## Summary

An **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability was discovered in the Cohere platform that allows authenticated users to perform unauthorized modifications or deletions
of their own user accounts.

Due to insufficient authorization validation on the User Management API, a user can directly invoke internal endpoints to change sensitive data such as their email
address or remove their account entirely, bypassing expected verification mechanisms.

---

## Technical Description

The vulnerability exists in the following endpoint:

```
/api/internal/v1/users/{{USER_ID}}
```

This endpoint incorrectly restricts access to sensitive operations.
By sending crafted HTTP requests, authenticated users can update or delete user-related information without proper permission checks.

---

### 1. Unauthorized Modification of User Data

Users can change critical profile fields such as **name**, **nickname**, or **email address** without verification.

#### Example Request

```javascript
const data = JSON.stringify({
  'locale': 'en',
  'email': 'unverified_email@unverified.com'
});

let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.open('PUT', 'https://example.com/api/internal/v1/users/{{USER_ID}}');
xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer {{TOKEN}}');
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
xhr.send(data);
```

This request successfully overwrites the user’s email address without triggering any validation or ownership checks.

---

### 2. Unauthorized Deletion of User Account

A user can also issue a `DELETE` request to remove their own record completely from the system.

#### Example Request

```javascript
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.open('DELETE', 'https://example.com/api/internal/v1/users/{{USER_ID}}');
xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer {{TOKEN}}');
xhr.send();
```

The server processes this request successfully, resulting in full deletion of the user account.

---

## Impact

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows:

* Unauthorized modification of sensitive account data
* Complete deletion of user records
* Potential service disruption or data integrity issues

Severity is classified as **High**, as it affects data confidentiality and system integrity.

---

## Root Cause

The access control mechanism does not verify that the authenticated user is authorized to perform operations on the targeted user resource.
This improper authorization check enables users to modify or delete their own data without confirmation or verification steps.

---

## Recommendation / Mitigation

* Enforce **strict server-side authorization** on all sensitive endpoints.
* Verify that the authenticated user **owns the resource** before processing modifications or deletions.
* Restrict modifiable fields to non-sensitive attributes.
* Require **email re-verification** or **re-authentication** for any sensitive profile changes.
* Log and monitor user modification and deletion requests for anomalies.
